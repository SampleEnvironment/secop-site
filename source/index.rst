      The SECoP (Sample Environment Communication Protocol) is an Inclusive, Simple
      and Self Explaining (ISSE) communication protocol, intended as a common standard
      for interfacing sample environment equipment and instrument control software.
      It is, coincidentally, developed by `ISSE
      <https://sampleenvironment.org/>`_.

      **Inclusive** means that facilities can use this protocol and don’t have
      to change their basic work flow.  Circulating and integration of equipment
      will be made easier.

   .. grid-item::

      **Simple** means it should be easy to integrate and to use, by humans and
      computers, for example using text-based messages instead of binary
      formats.

   .. grid-item::

      **Self Explaining** means that SECoP transports the data, metadata *and* a
      human and machine readable description, which allows environment control
      software to configure itself.

The :doc:`Introduction <intro/index>` section has examples of the protocol, as
well as example code to get started with writing drivers using one of our
implementations.

See the :doc:`Specification <specification/index>` section for the full specification.

In :doc:`Implementations <implementations/index>` you can see the known implementations, which
cover a wide range of use cases and technologies.

SECoP is a project started and coordinated by ISSE. The work was supported by
the SINE 2020 program from 2015 to 2019. From 2022 to 2024, as part of the
project SECoP\@HMC, the capabilities around metadata were extended to allow
easier interfacing with metadata initiatives working further up the stack.

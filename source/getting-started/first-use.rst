=================================
Getting to know the bare protocol
=================================

Here we want to show you, how to get started with SECoP.
We will begin by having a look on how to manually interact with a running SEC node.
In the end, you probably won't be using it this way, instead choosing a client which handles a lot of the logic for you.
Nevertheless, understanding what happens on the wire may be beneficial, so read on if you want to, or skip over to the secions about the clients.

.. TODO: links to sections!

------------------------------
Talking to a SEC node manually
------------------------------

So you have never used SECoP, and want to interact with a node?
For exploring the protocol, all you need is a program that can talk tcp or serial, depending on your device.
Connect to your device and send the following message to start communication ('>' and '<' show who is sending the message):

.. code::

    > *IDN?

The SEC node replies with the version number of the protocol that it wants to speak:

.. code::

    < ISSE,SECoP,V2019-09-16,v1.0

Great!
So we know, that we are talking to something that knows SECoP, but we do not know yet, what we are talking to.
That is what we will find out with next message:

We will format the answer a bit, since it is longer than the usual messages we will encounter. We will step through it afterwards:

SEC node information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

    < describing . {
        "equipment_id": "example_org.example_heater",
        "description": "a basic example temperature SEC node.",
        "firmware": "ExampleSECoPFirmware",
        "version": "2024.06",
        "interface": "tcp://10767"

The first few elements here are describing the capabilites of the SEC node itself.
They include the firmware and version, the exposed interfaces and the unique equipment ID.
The description is intended for humans to read.
It can be longer than the short example here, and in the best case should include information that is useful for the operator, like ... or whatever else could be needed by a human operator beyond the information that SECoP provides.

The next element contains all modules available on the SEC node: in this case ``outside`` and ``heater``

Module information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: json

    "modules": { "outside": { ... }, "heater": { ... } }

We will fist have a look at the smaller ``outside`` module:

.. code:: json

    "implementation": "example.sensors.Temperature",
    "description": "Outside temperature monitor.",
    "interface_classes": ["Readable"],
    "features": [],

The ``implementation`` string is not standardized, but gives a hint where to find the implementation for this Module for debugging purposes, e.g. the class or source file where this module is defined.
The ``interface_classes`` tells the client which capabilites the module supports.
In this case, it is a ``Readable`` which is a module with a ``value`` and a ``status`` that can both be read.
Addditional capabilites like custom commands or parameters are not excluded, this is a minimum set of things the Module has.
For a full definition, have a look at the specification.
The ``features`` field is similar to the interface classes, but Features are small additions in functionality, that can be plugged into any of the interface classes.
The description here can again give supplemental information about the module.

.. code:: json

    "accessibles": {
      "value": {
        "description": "current value of the module",
        "datainfo": {
          "type": "double",
          "unit": "째C"
        },
        "description": "temperature outside",
        "readonly": true
      },
      "status": {
        "description": "current status of the module",
        "datainfo": {
          "type": "tuple",
          "members": [
            {
              "type": "enum",
              "members": {
                "IDLE": 100,
                "WARN": 200,
                "ERROR": 400
              }
            },
            { "type": "string" }
          ]
        },
        "readonly": true
      }
    }

The ``accessibles`` field lists all parameters that are defined on the module and can be accessed over SECoP.
In the block above, you can see ``value`` and ``status`` two parameters which almost all Modules will have.
The value ist the current value of the module, and the status is a two-element tuple of a status code and a message that can give more information about the modules current state.
Each parameter has a description and information about data format, whether they can be written to, and more.

For the ``heater`` module, most things parallel the one before it, but there are some differences:

It is a ``Drivable`` which comes with additional things:
  - an additional status code ``BUSY``
  - a ``target`` which is a writable parameter
  - two commands (see below)
  - a custom parameter ``_maxheaterpower``

Every parameter or command which is not defined by the interface class or a feature has to be prefixed with an underscore.
This marks it as a custom field to prevent future name clashes with the standard but otherwise, it follows the same rules as a predefined parameter/command.

.. code:: json

    "_s": {
      "description": "Do stuff",
      "datainfo": {
        "type": "command",
        "argument": {
          "type": "struct",
          "members": {
            "a": {
              "min": 0.0,
              "max": 10.0,
              "type": "double"
            },
            "b": {
              "type": "double"
            }
          }
        },
        "result": {
          "type": "double"
        }
      }
    }

Commmands are like functions that you can call on a module, they can have arguments and results.
Here, we will only look at the ``_s`` command, since the predefined ``stop`` has no arguments and no result.
All the information is included in the datainfo field.
Every command in SECoP can only have a single argument, to make multi-argument functions, one has to use either a tuple or a struct, as shown above, where there are two named arguments ``a`` and ``b``
These follow the same rules as the parameter datatype definitions.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~

We now know the advertised capabilites of the SEC node, and armed with that knowledge, we can interact with specific parts of it.

Reading values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most basic command to access a module is the ``read`` message, where we can retrieve the value of a parameter:

.. code::

   > read outside:value
   < reply outside:value [23.2, {"t": 1212121.1212121}]

We have to specify which ``module`` and ``parameter`` we want to access, and get back an answer containing the value and so-called ``qualifiers`` which contain additional information.
Here, the only qualifier is ``t`` the timestamp of the read.

Writing values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If we want to set a value, for example the ``_maxheaterpower`` of the ``heater`` we can use the ``change`` message:

.. code::

   > change heater:_maxheaterpower 40.0
   < changed heater:_maxheaterpower [40.0, {"t": 1212121.1212121}]

We get the feedback, that the parameter was set.

If we try to set an invalid value, we get back an error:

.. code::

   > change heater:_maxheaterpower 200
   < error_change heater:_maxheaterpower ["RangeError", "200.0 must be between 0 and 100", {}]

Running commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running a command is done with the ``do`` message:

.. code::

   > do heater:stop
   < done heater:stop

As feedback that the command was run, we get back a ``done`` acknowledgement.

Actions that take longer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An important point is, that running commands or changing parameters does not block until the physical action is done.
To explain, if you set the target parameter to 20K above the current value, depending on what the heater actually heats, it may take a while to heat up.
In SECoP, you would immediately the feedback that the target was changed, and you would then see the value going up as the hardware does its job.
To know, when the command or parameter change is done, you have to have a look at the status.
It will go ``BUSY`` until the change is done.
When it returns to ``IDLE`` then the action is finished.

The other commands won't be discussed here, but as a pointer have a look at ``activate`` which gives you a stream of updates for all parameters of a SEC node or Module.
